                     Using Public Transportation:
                </h2>
                 <p class="maintext">
                    When it comes to public transportation, you essentially have three options: The U-Bahn, the S-Bahn, or the bus. <br> The nice thing is that the same ticket will work the same no matter which one you choose. If you’re ever wandering around and get lost then as long as you can find an U-bahn station then you should be able to find your way at least back to CIEE. We'll talk about that more in the specific U-bahn section, though. First, let’s talk about some of the differences between these forms of transportation.

                    <p>
                        The bus is probably one of the least used forms of transportation from my experience with CIEE, but that does not mean that they aren’t useful. While the U and S-Bahn map is given to you during orientation, the bus map is a little more complicated. The maps app on your phone will probably tell you the buses you need for a specific journey, but if you want more information then you can follow this: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bvg.de/en/Travel-information">link</a> and click on the purple bus circle to see the route of each individual bus route. There are two bus stops right next to CIEE. The 140 towards Ostbahnhof is right in front and a little to the left from the CIEE entrance and the 248 to Alexanderplatz is right around the left corner from CIEE. The bus is more likely to be held up by traffic, but it goes to places that the bahns do not and has USB charging ports near some seats, which can be super useful if you’re traveling and running low on battery. Lastly, some bus lines will replace U-bahn lines late at night or if a bahn is down due to construction.

                        The S-bahn is similar to the U-bahn except they go on different routes. The S-bahn generally goes a bit further than the U-bahn and does not have wifi at the stations. You will probably use the S-bahn if you want to go somewhere on the outskirts of the city. BE aware that if you’re going outside of the AB zone into the C zone of the city (look on your bahn map you were given at orientation to see where these zones begin and end) then you may have to buy an extra ticket at the S-bahn station specifically for that zone. Lastly, food and drink is allowed on the S-bahn.

                        Because the U-bahn is generally more for inner city transportation, rides can get crowded and, generally, you are not allowed to eat or drink while on the trains.  But, there is free BVG wifi at every u-bahn station, which means that, along with the maps that list connecting stations on the route maps and wifi you should be able to find your way to wherever you need to go if you happened to get lost in your travels around the city.  <br>
                        Especially if you’re traveling during rush hour, there may be times when the carriages are too full to enter. Luckily, the trains come pretty frequently (about 5-7 minutes apart during the day and about 10-15 minutes apart at night). Still, it’s probably smart to plan your trip to arrive on the train before the one you usually would take if you really need to make sure that you’re on time.

                        The first thing you want to know about the stove is that it needs to feel metal and conduction in order to turn on that burner. That means if the pan is not heavy enough or has too much crud on the bottom then it won't fully connect with the stovetop and, therefore, will not actually turn on that burner. So, if your burner keeps turning off, try using a heavier pan. <br>
                        In gerneral, to get the stove to work, you turn it on with the power button, select the circle that corresponds to the burner you would like to use, and use the + and - buttons to adjust the heat level. Keep in mind that these burners will boil water very wuickly, so turning the burner all the way up to 9 (the highest setting) then the burner will get hot very fast. <br>
                        And always make sure that you've selected the correst burner otherwise you may be turning on something you don't want to be or messing up the heat on something someone else is cooking.

                        The microwave has a lot of little tricks to it, but is pretty simple once you figure it out. <br>
                        The first thing you want to know is that the power button is the circle with a line through it. If not all of the buttons are lit up then this means that the microwave is off even if you can still interact with some of the other buttons. All you need to do is press the power button once and all the other buttons should show up. <br>
                        The two overlapping square boxes is the button to open the mircowave door. <br>
                        The up and down arrows are to change wether you're adjusting the power level or the time of the session. <br>
                        The left and right arrows increase or decrease whatever you're trying to adjust. They can also be used while the microwave is currently heating something as well. <br>

                        BUY YOUR OWN SET OF CHEEP DISHES WHEN YOU GET TO BERLIN!<br>
                        This seems unessicary, and it really would be if all the dishes stayed in the kitchen to be used communally. However, a lot of people will hord things like mugs, bowls, and food storage containers which means that there is usually a shortage of these. You can find pieces for pretty cheep on ebay or at the euro store (such as the one in the mall on the side of the Ferhnsehntraum on Alexanderplatz) and will save you a lot of hassle. <br>
                        Also, pretty pretty please scrape off any excess food into the trash can before you dump your stuff in the sinks. The drains clog super quickly and then make it a lot harder to do dishes if even one person does this. So image how much of a hassle it becomes when twenty or more people do this. Just please don't do it. <br>
                        If you keep any food in the kitchen then make sure the label it. Even though people shouldn't use stuff that isn't theirs, but there can sometimes be confusion between what is and is not communal. Either way, it's a lot easier to state your claim if your name is alreayd on something.
